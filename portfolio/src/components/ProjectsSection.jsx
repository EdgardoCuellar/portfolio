Rentizy is a property management MVP designed to simplify and automate the rental process for both property owners and tenants. From auto-generating rental contracts to handling maintenance reports and enabling property search for individuals and co-living arrangements, the platform centralizes everything.\
I co-founded the project with a partner who brought the initial idea and business expertise. I led the technical development using Django, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Azure, while we worked in agile methodology and with some UML schema with regular short call meetings. Later, we expanded the team to four by hiring a UI/UX designer and a backend developer.\
The project ran from November 2023 to January 2025, when I quit to focus on my long backpack trip.",

ShareHub is a full-featured second-hand marketplace I built alone during my master's thesis. The platform focuses on reselling university course materials with a redistributive economic model.\
I handled the entire development cycle‚Äîfrom backend logic with Django to frontend interfaces using TailwindCSS and JavaScript, plus deployment on Linux servers with Docker, Nginx, and Apache. The platform included advanced features such as encrypted messaging, account management, rating systems, and filtered searches.\
All UI/UX design was done by me, primarily using Photoshop. I also managed outreach and promotional efforts through social media and university networks.\

I also led a team expansion by recruiting two collaborators halfway through, helping scale our workload and improve efficiency.
