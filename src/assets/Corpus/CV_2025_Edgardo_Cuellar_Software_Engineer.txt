Graduated in Computer Science from ULB with high honors, I’ve been passionate about programming since
I was 14. I’ve worked on a lot of academic and personal projects, including Rentizy, a real estate
management MVP developed with three teammates. I enjoy starting projects from scratch and turning ideas
into concrete, functional products. After my master’s, I spent eight months travelling across Latin America
while continuing to contribute remotely, before stepping away from the project.
