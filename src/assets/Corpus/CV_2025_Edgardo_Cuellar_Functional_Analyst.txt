Graduated in Computer Science from ULB with high honors, I’ve been passionate about programming since
I was 14. Through projects like Rentizy, a real estate management MVP I co-developed with three
teammates, I learned to translate user needs into clear technical specifications. After my master’s, I spent
eight months travelling across Latin America while continuing to coordinate development and refine
requirements. I stepped away from the project during the trip to fully enjoy it.
