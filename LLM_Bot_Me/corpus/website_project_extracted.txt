From auto-generating rental contracts to handling maintenance reports and enabling property search for individuals and co-living arrangements, the platform centralizes everything.
I co-founded the project with a partner who brought the initial idea and business expertise. I led the technical development using Django, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Azure, while we worked in agile methodology and with some UML schema with regular short call meetings. Later, we expanded the team to four by hiring a UI/UX designer and a backend developer.
The project ran from November 2023 to January 2025, when I quit to focus on my long backpack trip.`,image:rh,link:"https://rentizy.io/"}},{title:"ShareHub",date:"2023 - 2024",description:"A second-hand syllabus marketplace built from scratch with a redistributive model",icon:"üåê",tools:["Django","TailwindCSS","JavaScript","SQL","Docker","Nginx","Apache","Photoshop"],details:{text:`ShareHub is a full-featured second-hand marketplace I built alone during my master's thesis. The platform focuses on reselling university course materials with a redistributive economic model.
I handled the entire development cycle, from backend logic with Django to frontend interfaces using TailwindCSS and JavaScript, plus deployment on Linux servers with Docker, Nginx, and Apache. I included some features like encrypted messaging, account management, rating systems, and filtered searches.
All UI/UX design was done by me, primarily using Photoshop. I also managed outreach and promotional efforts through social media and university networks.`,image:bh,link:"https://github.com/EdgardoCuellar/ShareHub"}},{title:"Communcation manager ESN ULB Brussels",date:"2023 - 2024",description:"Lead communications for an international student organization with 4K+ followers.",icon:"üñºÔ∏è",tools:["Photoshop","Illustrator","Canva","Social Media","Project Management"],details:{text:`As part of my student association (ESN), we needed a way to organize secure and anonymous internal votes. Most existing platforms were either paid or lacked transparency, so I decided to build our own.

ESN Vote System is a lightweight, open-source voting platform using public/private key encryption to ensure anonymity and vote integrity. Admins can easily open or close a vote, distribute unique keys, and display results dynamically through a live chart. Each key is tied to a single vote, making multiple submissions impossible.

This project was a way for me to apply what I had just learned in a cryptography course, and to prove that with a bit of code, we can replace overpriced services with simple, secure, and transparent tools.`,image:yh,link:"https://www.instagram.com/esnulbbrussels/"}},{title:"ESN Vote System",date:"2024",description:"Built a secure and anonymous voting system for my student association using cryptography.",icon:"üó≥Ô∏è",tools:["Django","Javascript","Crypto","Docker","Matplotlib","HTML","CSS"],details:{text:`  As Communication Manager at ESN ULB Brussels, I noticed the lack of free and reliable voting tools for our internal decisions. Most platforms were paid, so I decided to build our own system ‚Äî simple, secure, and anonymous.

  ESN Vote System uses public/private key cryptography to ensure that each member can vote only once and that all votes remain anonymous. Keys are distributed in advance, and results are dynamically displayed using graphs. Admins can open or close voting sessions, verify key validity, and manage everything through a lightweight interface.

  This project was also an opportunity to apply concepts from a cryptography course I had recently completed and to create something directly useful for the community.`,image:null,link:"https://github.com/EdgardoCuellar/esn_vote_system"}},{title:"Shark Classifier & Generative AI",date:"2023",description:"An image classification and generation model for aquatic animals and candy",icon:"üéÆ",tools:["PyTorch","CNN","ImageNet","Generative Models"],details:{text:`This short project involved classifying images of sharks, dolphins, and whales using a convolutional neural network built with PyTorch. Once we removed the final classification layer, we repurposed the model into a generative network capable of producing realistic shark images from noise.
We trained it on an open-source animal dataset (ImageNet) before training a similar network to classify different Haribo candy types because why not?

The system handled large datasets efficiently and provided personalized suggestions while maintaining scalability. We fine-tuned the performance using Spark‚Äôs and integrated it into a clean frontend demo to show the results.

It supported arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, and jumps.
The project aimed to help us deeply understand parsing, evaluation, and compiler theory. We wrote a full interpreter from scratch in Python, simulating a low-level execution model.
Designing and debugging a language from the ground up was one of the most mentally challenging and rewarding experiences I've had in code.`,image:null,link:"https://github.com/EdgardoCuellar/FortressLanguage"}},{title:"MNIST Number Recognizer",date:"2022",description:"A basic handwritten digit recognizer using a multilayer neural network",icon:"üî¢",tools:["LLM","CUDA","MNIST","Neural Network"],details:{text:`In this project, we implemented and explained a simple neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Built with a multi-layer perceptron and trained on an NVIDIA GPU using CUDA, the core of the model (as we joked) was basically just a fancy pile of matrix multiplications.
